    Milestone 1:  
    Due: Friday, September 28, 2018 11:59 PM
    - First Come First Served scheduling
    - PCB File Loading

    Milestone 2:  
    Due: Friday, October 5, 2018 11:59 PM
    - Priority scheduling
    - Scheduling statistics
    - Round Robin scheduling

Note: 
1. After you run assignment3_test, the PCBs.bin will be created in the ./test directory.
   you can run the analysis program like "./analysis ../test/PCBs.bin RR 4", or you can simply copy and paste the PCBs.bin to the ./build directory, and then run "./analysis PCBs.bin RR 4".
     
2. You can manually copy the time analysis from console and paste it to this readme file, but directly output from your program is a better way.
